Still available!  Kim's first Ravello Release from 2012, Birdsong In Mist, is still out there!  Including November Falling Fast and Steel Eye (recently reinvented for the prize winning soundtrack for \#MurderSelfie) and remixes by the legend that is Rat Scabies you can still find the album on iTunes.  

Hypnagogue reviews said:

At the heart of Birdsong in Mist is Halliday's splendid playing. His piano work runs deep with emotion; his use o

f the space between notes is potent. The range of instrumentation and breadth of style speaks to his talent. (In case you're looking for a score for your next high-tension film scene, you'll want to have a listen to the very dramatic "Victim Selection.") What's more, he crams these 15 fully realized vignettes into less than an hour's time and nothing feels rushed or lacking. I've given Birdsong in Mist a lot of listen-time since it arrived, and it just gets better the more and the deeper I listen.http://hypnagogue.net/2013/01/30/kim-halliday-birdsong-in-mist/
