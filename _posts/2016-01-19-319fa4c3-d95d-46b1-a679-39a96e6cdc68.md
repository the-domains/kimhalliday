Kim is a composer & musician. He played the violin at age 7, took up the guitar at 13, and spent his early teens trying to become Jimmy Page. Rescued from a life in Prog Rock by Dr Feelgood, and after years of punk, new wave, psychobilly and ska, Kim decided that life in a sweaty van with 3 blokes he hated wasn't a sensible career goal, so he signed up to the London Film School to learn to write music to picture.  His policy of accepting any job means he's written and played scores for feature films, documentaries, video & theatre.  His latest score, for \#MurderSelfie (a short from Two Bells Productions), has recently won the 2015 Independent Horror Movies Award for Best Score.
