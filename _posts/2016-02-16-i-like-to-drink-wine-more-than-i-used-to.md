# I like to drink wine more than I used to...

So here's the deal:

I recognise that you are all busy people, and
that the amount of music you _could _listen to increases exponentially
every day. I mean, I love the fact that I can get instant musical gratification
by downloading or streaming anything I every heard (providing I can remember
the name of the piece or the artist!) and my life is much better for that.  On the other side, like you, I'm bombarded by
new music that I can't possibly listen to (even if I wanted to) because I'm not
awake for enough hours in the day.  So I
probably miss some things I'd like because I had to prioritise what I listened
to. 

Let me introduce myself,
Gentle Reader.  I'm a composer and musician
working in London, England.  Most of my
work has been music written to picture or for picture, and I've scored feature
films, short films, theatre, television, installations and multimedia
projects.  I've also written for 'cello,
string quartet, other small ensembles and I studied at the London Film
School.  Lately I've used real
instruments with studio effects and processors to manipulate and distort
sounds, and I like to use found sound and real voices.  Oh, and guitars -- lots of guitars.  I have a large collection of stringed
instruments that I pluck, bow, strum and mostly twang and then record.  One of my friends once said my music
comforted and disturbed in equal measure, and I stole that and use it as my
Mission Statement.  I guess you could
categorise it as a bit Trip-hop-py, sometimes Psychedelic, slightly alt,
slightly experimental, moments of punk, often distorted, occasionally pretty.  Or perhaps that's just what I aspire to. 

And, you will be unsurprised
to learn, I nearly always have some new music available that I would dearly
love to you to hear and to enjoy and like.  The problem is, if no one listens, then it's really like that whole
"trees falling in forests when nobody is there to hear them fall" thing.  I could get all Zen and Schrodinger's Cat
about it, and fundamentally, I create music because I can't stop myself from
creating it, but I'd like people to hear it, to listen to it, and to tell me
what they liked about it.  I even don't really
mind if people don't like it -- not everyone will like it, and I'd rather be me
than One Direction, thanks.

But I've done the usual kind
of thing you do when you're promoting new stuff, I've bored people to death on Social
Media, I've set up free downloads, there's a sampler with clips from all the
tracks.  There's an EPK available.  I've got t-shirts and posters and flyers and
chocolate bars - you know the kind of thing.

As I touched on earlier, I
like to score films, and I like to watch other people's films and listen to
other people's scores.  I've seen the
Godfather so many times I could probably recite all the dialogue from beginning
to end.  And while I was thinking about promotion, a scene from the Godfather popped into mind (no, not the one with the horses head in the bed) where Bonasera the
Undertaker asks Don Corleone to revenge his daughters beating, and Don Corleone
says "Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service
for me" -- do you remember?

Here's the deal.  You listen to my work.  That's your favour to me.  You need some music for something -- you
contact me, and say, "I read your piece, I listened to your stuff.  Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this
service?" And I will.

There are some
caveats, of course, small print, quid pro quo etc etc.  I won't do anything illegal, immoral,
offensive, unpleasant, hideously expensive or involving appearing on reality
television.  To continue to (mis) quote
the Don "I'm not going to be carried away.  I mean, we're not murderers, in spite of what
this undertaker thinks..."

I will happily, however,
provide music for you!  So bear that in
mind, when you choose which new music to listen to today, because this might be
an offer you can't refuse...

Kim Halliday has probably spent
too many hours watching movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas and Once Upon A
Time In America.  However, none of his
instrument cases contains a firearm, and none of his work is organised
crime-themed music.
